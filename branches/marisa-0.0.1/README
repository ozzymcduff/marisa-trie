Project summary:
  Nesting Patricia -> Matryoshka Patricia -> Matricia -> Marisa.

Description:
  marisa-trie provides a C++ library and command line tools for a nesting
  patricia that is designed as a static and space efficient dictionary
  structure. A nesting patricia enables not only a simple lookup but also a
  prefix search and a predictive search, as well as a trie does.

   * A prefix search is to find keys from prefixes of a given query.
   * A predictive search is to find keys starting with a given query.

  One of the advantages of marisa-trie is in its space efficiency. See below
  for the size of dictionaries built with various trie implementations.

   * Input
    * Source: enwiki-20100622-all-titles-in-ns0
    * Number of keys: 7,967,237
    * Total size: 160,340,531 bytes

  || *Implementation* || *Size (bytes)* || *Remarks*                   ||
  || darts-clone      ||    303,413.248 || Compacted double-array trie ||
  || tx-trie          ||    102,802,911 || LOUDS-based trie            ||
  || marisa-trie      ||     41,304,635 || Nesting patricia trie       ||

  The marisa-trie dictionary is remakably compact in these implementations and
  its size is only 1/4 of the input size.
